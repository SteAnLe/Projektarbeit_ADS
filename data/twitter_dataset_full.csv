1.59772E+18,"Because of US Soccer's new equal pay agreement, men and women split World Cup prize money.

With the USMNT advancing today, the two teams will each receive $6.5 million minimum.

That's more than the USWNT got for winning both the 2015 and 2019 World Cups combined: $6 million. https://t.co/pGHS7XuGP8"
1.59772E+18,"In February, the USWNT agreed to a settlement with the U.S. Soccer, ending a 6-year lawsuit.

It included a $24M payment and adjustments to how players are compensated going forward — including splitting World Cup prizes.

@owenpoindexter goes in depth ⤵️
https://t.co/KZnCMuZvKU"
1.59772E+18,@FOS Did the men get $6mil after the women’s victories? (Genuinely asking how this works.)
1.59772E+18,"@bentonmunyan @FOS My understanding is that as of February, winnings are split going forward, so if the USWNT wins $50M in the 2023 World Cup (they won't -- there won't be that much prize money) the men would get half."
1.59772E+18,@FOS Generating revenue should matter
1.59772E+18,@FOS the comment section has epically failed the vibe check of this news
1.59772E+18,@FOS @Zeno So you telling me the USMNT and the USWNT had a divorce.
1.59772E+18,@FOS Bruh 🤡
1.59772E+18,@FOS https://t.co/PqosHDKXNP
1.59772E+18,@FOS So pretty much like housewives? So progressive
1.59772E+18,@FOS why don't they play a match for it?
1.59772E+18,@olivertraldi @FOS I see what you did there 🤓
1.59772E+18,@FOS 🤡
1.59772E+18,@FOS https://t.co/VIlYN6TlpZ
1.3536E+18,I think this back and forth explains the differences in men’s and women’s sports and pay gaps. https://t.co/NwJsq8eQSn
1.59772E+18,"@FOS It’s hard for me to express how much I hate this. Pro female soccer players work hard, make sacrifices, etc., but…. You cannot FORCE people to prefer/value one league over another. I will pay more to watch men play because it’s a far better athletic display, simple as that."
1.59772E+18,"@FOS If the Womens World Cup generates a fraction of the revenue that the mens does, how is this fair ?"
1.59772E+18,@FOS Sounds like a divorce settlement: what he owns is ours
1.59772E+18,@FOS Should we not as taxpayers receive a portion of the winnings as well?
1.59772E+18,@FOS Lmfaooo they degrading men. Only in US.
1.59772E+18,@FOS @JSamanthaRivera I love getting paid for things I don’t deserve also
1.59772E+18,@FOS How y'all mad women's team get the same earnings as the men. Yet the women have 4 or 5 World Cup titles
1.59772E+18,"@FOS The total prize pool of the 2019 Women’s World Cup was $30 million. Smaller prize pools = smaller prizes per team. Also, the 2019 USWNT lost to a u-15 boys team."
1.59772E+18,@FOS At this point I and a lot of people don’t understand how this works and we’re scared to ask questions and possibly disagree because u can’t do that now
1.59772E+18,@FOS So you’re saying that men’s brings in more money than women’s?
1.59772E+18,@FOS How’s that compare to other womens national teams in other countries?
1.59772E+18,@FOS A disgrace what have USWNT done to deserve that? Certainly not bring in viewership?
1.59772E+18,@FOS @Morganhimself
1.59772E+18,@FOS Now compare revenues between the men &amp; women over the last 8 years
1.59772E+18,@FOS https://t.co/ZV4BdfpSSF
1.59772E+18,@FOS Do the men get 50% of the individual marketing deals of the women on the national team??
1.59772E+18,@FOS So women’s team just got 6.5 million for sitting at home while the men win. Keep that same energy next year.
1.59772E+18,@FOS Honest question: how much does the women’s World Cup generate in revenue
1.59772E+18,@FOS Genuine question about how this works. Would the men also get a portion from the women's world cup?
1.59772E+18,@FOS Please don’t cancel me. I am trying to understand this a little. https://t.co/FxcIFYvugu
1.59772E+18,"@FOS There's a reason why the two achievements are incomparable. For all the snowflakes who can't wait to label it sexism, it isn't. The ability, quality and skill of the women's game is far inferior. Anyone who argues otherwise is very, very thirsty!"
1.59772E+18,@FOS LFGGGGG
1.59772E+18,@FOS Sigh
1.59772E+18,@FOS A small win for the womens team after getting fucked for so long
1.59772E+18,@FOS @NatetheLawyer
1.59772E+18,@FOS Awful that women's soccer gets to take the men's money. Men's soccer generates more revenue because more people want to watch it world wide. Might as well start paying the WNBA players like the NBA players too while we're at it.
1.59772E+18,@FOS @MattDoyle76 Hmmmm
1.59772E+18,"@FOS ridiculous, if we're being honest"
1.59772E+18,@FOS That's generous of them.
1.59772E+18,@FOS Love seeing men comment about equal pay in a sport they make fun of and care nothing about.
1.59772E+18,@FOS not every player is called up to the national team again... so how do they decide who the money goes to?
1.59772E+18,@FOS @nicolefer_ That’s insane 😳
1.59772E+18,@FOS Just like marriage. Now do NBA lol
1.59772E+18,@FOS So its like they really are one nation. One team. 👍🏾
1.59772E+18,@FOS 🤔
1.59772E+18,"@FOS @Melissa_OU6 Where’s all the feminist at the women’s cup or wnba games? Fill up their stadiums, buy their merchandise and generate the same revenue the men’s teams do and the equal pay is right."
1.59772E+18,@FOS So does this mean because of the split the men will receive less than they would have originally because they have to give a portion of it to the women’s team?
1.59772E+18,"@FOS Why the men’s team agreed to this is beyond me, unless they receive the same amount they would normally receive &amp; the extra funding for the women come from another pot"
1.59772E+18,@FOS WHAT A JOKE. SITTIN AT HOME DOING NOTHING WHILE OUR MEN ARE DEFENDING THE BACK LINES WITH THEIR LIVES.
1.59772E+18,"@FOS Personally i say put the money in one pot, winner take all 🇺🇸"
1.59772E+18,@FOS In a country where female football is so much success than men ever did is a joke 🤣
1.59772E+18,@FOS Getting paid for not doing anything. That’s pretty embarrassing.
1.59772E+18,@FOS I wonder if the NBA would agree to do this with the WNBA?
1.59772E+18,@FOS That’s absolute 🐎 💩
1.59772E+18,@FOS Good
1.59772E+18,@FOS That doesn’t sound like equality
1.59772E+18,@FOS This is satire
1.59772E+18,@FOS I am no longer rooting for the US team
1.59772E+18,@FOS 👀
1.59772E+18,@FOS @MC_Brooks Our women’s team has been much better than the men’s team for years. A lot of you just hate women.
1.59772E+18,@FOS Can’t wait til the women complain they only get $3mil for winning the WWC in their next CBA.  This is their MOA.
1.59772E+18,"@FOS Women's team after flying 1st class, staying at top hotel charging everything to the room. Watching the game front row.... https://t.co/UoahE4dF4m"
1.59772E+18,"@FOS What if they identify as both man and women, do they get all the money?"
1.59772E+18,@FOS *more than the USWNT got for winning world cup’s while the men couldn’t even qualify. Oops.
1.59772E+18,@FOS How do they spilt given the team roster is constantly changing? Which version of the women’s team gets it?
1.59772E+18,@FOS 🤔
1.59772E+18,@FOS Splitting it is ridiculous. The two team’s pay structure in how they were paid was different so you couldn’t compare the two. Each team agreed to their own compensation structures and in the end it didn’t benefit the women and then they complained.
1.59772E+18,@FOS No way 😂🤦🏾‍♂️
1.59772E+18,@FOS So tired of this
1.59772E+18,@FOS Socialism 101
1.59772E+18,@FOS And that seems fair to you?
1.59772E+18,"@FOS This tweet was incredibly poorly written (which I’m sure was your intention). FIFA does not pay the US players - men’s or women’s. They distribute funds to national federations, who can do whatever they want or whatever they have contracted to do"
1.59772E+18,@FOS Lol women now getting paid for doing nothing…. Amazing
1.59772E+18,@FOS Seems really fair...
1.59772E+18,@FOS Such a joke
1.59772E+18,@FOS Sooooo this means I should be able to share in my CEOs Christmas bonus right?
1.59772E+18,"@FOS This is fantastic! With this logic, I’ve decided to start a handbag company, and if no one buys my handbags I’ll just split the revenue with Louis Vuitton! America!"
1.59772E+18,@FOS Is the NBA and WNBA splitting revenue as well?
1.59772E+18,@FOS But they are not competing in the same market. Men’s soccer is a huge business worldwide with way more revenue than womens soccer. Has nothing to do with who is more skilled or who is putting in more work… it is nonsense
1.59772E+18,"@FOS This whole thing is bizarre. It’s basically 2 completely different sports. One has a lot of revenue, the other very little. How they earn anything close to equal baffles me. It’s apples and oranges but just because they wear the same jersey…"
1.59772E+18,@FOS Men’s team paying alimony?
1.59772E+18,"@FOS Damn. Men still the bread winners, huh?"
1.59772E+18,"@FOS The USWNT doesn't generate the same amount of revenue. I don't care how many games they win. Less interest/viewers/revenue = less wages. Their product is less profitable than the USMNT's. That's reality. Your Chevette isn't a Corvette, even though  both were produced by Chevy."
1.59772E+18,"@FOS @MichLovesMoney They're worth it 

https://t.co/lLX6qgner8"
1.59772E+18,"@FOS @TaylorTwellman People forget that pulisic’s salary at Chelsea is $7M and Alex Morgan’s in the NWSL is $500k
These guys are not playing for their country for money. It’s all for glory on the men’s side"
1.59772E+18,@FOS I see a lot of American men suddenly pretending to care/know about about soccer in this thread who wouldn't care/know about it under about any other circumstance. I wonder what the common denominator is...
1.59772E+18,@FOS @MrI3200 🔥🔥🔥
1.59772E+18,@FOS @GoodKidManCity Now everyone gonna complain about other peoples money. Go outside and kick the ball around
1.59772E+18,@FOS This is blatant sexism and y’all are applauding it. Rewarding bad behavior never ends well
1.59772E+18,"@FOS @RobertWClark7 Why are people upset? 

USA USA USA USA USA"
1.59772E+18,@FOS That’s so lame.
1.59772E+18,@FOS Good everything should be fair!!
1.59772E+18,@FOS Oof absolutely should not be splitting the pay. Nothing equal about that.
1.59772E+18,@FOS What a joke
1.59772E+18,@FOS Long time coming! ❤️👏👏👏
1.59772E+18,@FOS Makes sense
1.59772E+18,@FOS It’s the opposite of the feminist movement.  They increased their income reliance on men.  #sugardaddysoccer Team USA.
1.59772E+18,@FOS FINALLY One Nation One Team for real.
1.59772E+18,@FOS It's a very small percentage of people that care about ALL of women's sports.  And a big chunk of that small percentage is friends and family.
1.59772E+18,@FOS https://t.co/i1gYvqpUB8
1.59772E+18,@FOS That’s hilarious.
1.59772E+18,@FOS Same with the WNBA.   Why aren’t women packing these stadiums?
1.59772E+18,"@FOS How do they determine who is included  in the bonus payout pool? For example - If the men earn $12million this year, who from the women is able to collect from their $million share??"
1.59772E+18,@FOS Ridiculous
1.59772E+18,@FOS Random thought: Would there be a seize fire request by NATO for the women’s World Cup? Nope.
1.59772E+18,@FOS Splitting makes WC prize $ literally makes 0 sense…
1.59772E+18,"@FOS If Bill Burr can figure this out anyone can. It has nothing to do with ability or results. It’s all about advertising dollars and how much networks pay for the broadcast…period. Get more people to watch, make more money."
1.59772E+18,"@FOS Everyone want’s everything to be equal. Guess what, life isn’t equal!"
1.59772E+18,@FOS Chicks alway have they hands in bros pockets 😕
1.59772E+18,@FOS Mens tournament has way more eyeballs
1.59772E+18,@FOS Robbery
1.59772E+18,@FOS Socialism at it finest
1.59772E+18,"@FOS Talk about an all-time money grab. Would probably effect the talent pool for the USWNT because there $$$ incentive to stay even when your past your prime. This isn’t going to result in better performance, and assume women will dominate forever…interesting stuff"
1.59772E+18,@FOS Hahahahha what a joke!!!!
1.59772E+18,@FOS This a joke? Lol
1.59772E+18,"@FOS Happy for the @USWNT,  but this fact is infuriating."
1.59772E+18,@FOS @raeannrambles I say they play each other for it…ya know…equality
1.59772E+18,@FOS It's unironically more convenient in today's world as the USMNT isn't utter garbage and can actually kind of hold their own. Otherwise I'd bed the Women make more tournament money than them.
1.59772E+18,@FOS In what world is this fair?
1.59772E+18,"@FOS The USMNT has 26 players on it. The last women's world cup had 23 players. If the WWC stays at 23 players and they're splitting 6.5 million between the 2 teams, who then divide it among their members, each woman would actually make more than the men. Even though the men advanced"
1.59772E+18,@FOS Yeah bc the women’s world couple make a couple million compared to the men’s World Cup that makes over 7 billion
1.59772E+18,"@FOS If Bollywood’s best actor(no offense) went to Hollywood studios and said „I want the same salary as Brad Pitt right now!, coz I am just as skilled and do exactly the same work“, would he succeed? No! ….this has nothing to do with gender!"
1.59772E+18,"@FOS Which is absolutely ridiculous. Aside from men's and women's soccer being essentially different sports in terms of the level of skill, competitiveness (way easier to win the women's WC) &amp; revenue generation the USWNT had a contract they signed which they thought favored them."
1.59772E+18,@FOS That’s unfair
1.59772E+18,@FOS Goodness at the men with their panties in a wad bc women are going to earn the same as them.  Y’all are pathetic.
1.59772E+18,@FOS I just love all the ppl in this thread pretending to care and be offended for an organization that is fine with this agreement and approved it. Weirdos man.
1.59772E+18,@FOS @TaylorTwellman Ya this makes a lot of sense!
1.59772E+18,@FOS can we just be happy that soccer in the us just got a massive stimmy?
1.59772E+18,@FOS Th women relying on the men as always 🤦‍♂️
1.59772E+18,@FOS @jetsfan53
1.59772E+18,@FOS USWNT are greedy
1.59772E+18,@FOS Going the right direction :)
1.59772E+18,@FOS The woman’s team getting money they don’t deserve is what I’m reading
1.59772E+18,@FOS All the angry white dudes in the comments exposing themselves😂
1.59772E+18,"@FOS Most of their “competition” was of the Thai national team quality

What was the revenue generated by their tournaments? I’m guessing not so much given the only country with interest in women’s soccer (including virtue signaling wokes) was in the USA. 

But yeah—totally deserve it"
1.59772E+18,@FOS I have two words for the little boys crying over the women's team getting paid: cry harder.
1.59772E+18,@FOS @IamNooNoo the comments 👀
1.59772E+18,"@FOS Pathetic from the WNT. It's one thing to ask for equal lodging, per diem, etc. To dip into the men's WC prize money is greedy beyond belief. I didn't see anyone from the WNT out there on the field today getting kicked in the balls. WC money shouldn't be shared."
1.59772E+18,@FOS This is communism
1.59772E+18,@FOS @USWNTPlayers This is called “Back Pay”.  More then Deserved!  Pay the Woman!!!
1.59772E+18,@FOS Thank you to the men for standing by them
1.59772E+18,@FOS @TotalSoccerShow https://t.co/Pvw1dyIFGX
1.59772E+18,"@FOS I’m not sure who thinks this is fair. Regardless it’s USMNT or USWNT, whoever brings the money deserves their fair share. Why will the women’s team take men’s share in this World Cup and the same applies if the women’s team won the World Cup."
1.59772E+18,"@FOS I respect if the men voted for the pay to be split out of principle, but let's call it like this is: charity."
1.59772E+18,"@FOS The USMNT will also share the winnings from next years WWC. Although, I can't see the women winning the tournament this time."
1.59772E+18,@FOS Seems very unfair. The men's team will receive half of what their peers in other national teams will. Why do they have to basically subsidize the women's pay? Not their fault that men's football competitions generate substantially more revenue than the women's.
1.59772E+18,@FOS That's a scam and the men fell for it 🤷‍♂️
1.59772E+18,@FOS That’s good because the womens team been carrying the US in soccer for quite awhile lol
1.59772E+18,"@FOS That is a ridiculous system. 

Male sports generate more revenue if supporters of women's sports want to see things on a more even playing field they should go support women's sports."
1.59772E+18,@FOS @embustetatto nem pra seleção brasileira aderir a esse acordo tbm…
1.59772E+18,@FOS All of a sudden the culture in Qatar doesn't sound too bad...
1.59772E+18,@FOS Socialism hard at work
1.59772E+18,"@FOS I don’t deny that the women should get the money that is owed to them. But when the prize money is smaller, you get smaller bonuses for winning. If people only chip in $10 for a raffle, then the prize will not be as good than if $100 was donated"
1.59772E+18,@FOS @ClayTravis did you see this?
1.59772E+18,@FOS Women taking men’s hard earned money away from them? Color me shocked!!!
1.59772E+18,@FOS Complete BS
1.59772E+18,"@FOS And you thought this was going to be welcome information, didn't you?"
1.59772E+18,@FOS We have a girls team? Since when
1.59772E+18,@FOS Big yikes. No money in Women’s soccer 🤷‍♀️
1.59772E+18,@FOS https://t.co/cdkMPT35pU
1.59772E+18,@FOS That’s because no one cares about women’s soccer
1.59772E+18,@FOS This is good news
1.59772E+18,@FOS there’s a women’s world cup?
1.59772E+18,"@FOS If the women get money for doing nothing, then shouldn’t the men get money too if the women succeed next year? It’s only fair. If they can get money for doing nothing, then the men should too. What? If the Bulls win the NBA Finals, then should…"
1.59772E+18,"@FOS The logic behind this is that IN THE PAST the women's team was much better than the men's, but only men got the big money. Today, the USWNT is clearly inferior to what they were 3 or 4 years ago (mediocre coach and directos). USMNT are not great, that's also true. So, relax."
1.59772E+18,@FOS I took my daughter to a few women’s World Cup games in the south of France three years ago. There was a grand total of about 100 people in the stands for each game. Just about every game in freaking Qatar for the men has been packed. This makes a hell of a lot of sense.
1.59772E+18,@FOS Cause the men's tournament has a global audience.  The women's tournament audience is limited to leafy American suburbs.
1.59772E+18,@FOS What a joke. Nobody watches the women's game which means less advertising and ticket dollars. There is zero reason they should split what the men bring in
1.59772E+18,"@FOS The men’s team are perennial losers I’m not clear why they are even paid, LMAO"
1.59772E+18,@FOS Just gonna leave this here https://t.co/x9IfURpTMG
1.59772E+18,@FOS This is cool and all but if one generates higher revenue then it calls to pay those specific athletes more…
1.59772E+18,"@FOS Look the men usually don't win ... the women do...And if you don't win in the World Cup you don't get money...  So more than not the women will win and share their money... but when the men win it's more money... But it all will even out in the end, not hard to understand!"
1.59772E+18,@FOS What do you expect. Soccer federation president is a flaming Left-wing activist and a corporate socialist type. Truly unfair for the men. I stopped watching the woman's side after their virtue signaling. Screw them.
1.59772E+18,"@FOS I wonder how that $$ is allocated among the players. Rosters evolve; some players contribute to qualifying but aren’t on the finals roster. I especially wonder, in the case of that $6.5 million to each team, how it will be apportioned to women players. Who’s eligible for a share?"
1.59772E+18,@FOS Just wait for the complaints when the USWNT wins the 🏆 and the USMNT gets half the money for sitting at home. It'll be nice beer money for them during the off-season
1.59772E+18,@FOS This makes no sense!!! They didn't do anything!!!
1.59772E+18,@FOS 🤔
1.59772E+18,@FOS It’s unfair to take money from the men’s teams earnings when the issue is FIFA and advertisers. They should fund both equally but would never.
1.59772E+18,@FOS Lmao must be nice becoming millionaires for doing absolutely nothing.
1.59772E+18,"@FOS Spend the same money on both programs (salaries, coaches, facilities, travel, insurance, nutrition, psychologists, tattoos, marketing, etc.) and let the chips fall independently based on results."
1.59772E+18,@FOS Finally! USWNT getting paid for being a team that wins and we can actually root for
1.59772E+18,"@FOS That's a terrible deal, and the men should've said no. Let them earn what they earn. Whatever the FIFA prize money is when the women win, that's theirs. Whatever the men earn, same. People should be paid for their work and performance, not someone else's."
1.59772E+18,@FOS do they bring in equal revenue?
1.59772E+18,@FOS Didn't Hope Solo make a bunch of extra money from the Fappening? Did she share that? 🤮🤮🤮
1.59772E+18,@FOS Sounds like communism to me.
1.59772E+18,@FOS This is click bait.  both teams get the same now.
1.59772E+18,@FOS I don’t understand why
1.59772E+18,@FOS Women thriving off mens success #equality
1.59772E+18,@FOS How is this empowering women? When the revenue they generate is riding the coattails of the men’s team?
1.59772E+18,@FOS They should pay out those teenage boys that destroyed them too
1.59772E+18,@FOS https://t.co/3uki4SS2Ra
1.59772E+18,@FOS let them play for it
1.59772E+18,@FOS Just like marriage
1.59772E+18,"@FOS they couldn't generate the money themselves so under the excuse of equal payment are now stealing money, makes sense"
1.59772E+18,@FOS Does this mean the USWNT is going to stop losing teenage boys teams?
1.59772E+18,@FOS So if the womens team win they split it too?
1.59772E+18,@FOS I would also like 6 million dollars for being an American and not contributing to USMNT
1.59772E+18,"@FOS People in this thread keep saying how the USWNT doesn't bring in the same amount of money as the USMNT, but nobody mentions how the women's team gets a fraction of the investment $ the men's team does. A women's international friendly just sold out Wembley ffs."
1.59772E+18,@FOS So next year when the women win the men get money to or we just double standards out here
1.59772E+18,@FOS Will the men get paid when the women win? Ooooooof course not
1.59772E+18,@FOS The women should thank the men for the pay raise
1.59772E+18,@FOS These females don’t deserve anything if they don’t bring in the revenue.
1.59772E+18,@FOS Seems fair. Both teams will get paid for playing and supporting the other. #merica
1.59772E+18,@FOS that’s fucking insane that the prize for making the men’s tournament around 4x the prize for winning the women’s tournament.
1.59772E+18,@FOS Absolutely disgusting 🤢
1.59772E+18,@FOS @TaylorTwellman https://t.co/EdK5yyUr12
1.59772E+18,@FOS wouldn't mind it if the WNT played teams that were similar to what the MNT plays against
1.59772E+18,@FOS So the women's team gets half the men's team winnings for doing absolutely nothing??

1.4961E+18,U.S. Soccer and @USWNT are proudly standing together in a shared commitment to advancing equality in soccer. https://t.co/Sp8q7NY0Up
1.4961E+18,"@ussoccer @FIFAcom @USWNT More detail: Under the terms of the agreement, the athletes will receive $24 million and a pledge from the federation to equalize pay for the men’s and women’s national teams"
1.4961E+18,"@ussoccer @FIFAcom @USWNT Also, U.S Soccer pledges to equalize pay between the men’s and women’s national teams in all competitions, including the World Cup, in the teams’ next collective bargaining agreements"
1.4961E+18,"@ussoccer @USWNT They don’t deserve equal pay, they deserve MORE pay. The men can’t win a game, while the women win championships. Why should the men get equal pay?!"
1.4961E+18,"@alexthayer_arky @ussoccer @USWNT the mens team generates revenue 

the women's team does not

this is about economics not Equality"
1.4961E+18,"@ussoccer @USWNT the mens team generates revenue 

the women's team does not

this is about economics not Equality"
1.4961E+18,@ussoccer @USWNT 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
1.4961E+18,"@ussoccer @USWNT So you're going to pay the men more, then? Because the women were already being paid more, and this just makes it even more lopsided."
1.4961E+18,"@ussoccer @USWNT no disrespect but they make less because they play at a lower level. 
why don’t MLS players make as much as Premier League players? Bc the Premier League is at another level. 
The USWNT has won World Cup after World Cup and would still lose to the USMNT, easily."
1.4961E+18,@qvxla_ @ussoccer @USWNT MLS gets paid low because they are a single entity league without each club being privately owned and financially backed by big corporations.... educate yourself.
1.4961E+18,"@ussoccer @USWNT In any other European Football team, I would consider the old argument; men are performing better &amp; bringing in more revenue.
But in the USA, where the men’s national team can’t make the 1/4 finals &amp; women have won the tournament a few times! No excuse.
Congrats #USWNT #football"
1.4961E+18,@ussoccer @USWNT Its funny how they winning world cups at womens level can compare at trying to win a world cup at Mens level. Its like wnba players asking for equal pay cause they always win gold in the olympics.

1.4961E+18,@ussoccer @USWNT 👍🇺🇸⚽️
1.4961E+18,@ussoccer @USWNT Finally.  And  pressure needs to be continued to the international organization.
1.4961E+18,"@ussoccer @USWNT That’s great, but “resolved our long-standing dispute over equal pay” doesn’t give much detail. Are incentive bonuses gonna be equal now? What about the domestic leagues?"
1.4961E+18,@ussoccer @USWNT Funny how money brings people together like that. 😏
1.4961E+18,"@ussoccer @USWNT Can’t wait for them to still complain, about something they have already agreed to in this 😂"

1.4961E+18,@ussoccer @USWNT Will the Women fight as hard to allow stronger males who think they’re women play in the same league?
1.4961E+18,"@ussoccer @USWNT We're so proud of you! 😺🐾💙
Not a peep of congratulation from MNT, though? 😼
How normal 🐾"
1.4961E+18,@ussoccer @GretchenCarlson @USWNT Thank you @USWNT and #USWNT only. ♀️
1.4961E+18,@ussoccer @USWNT NWSL still pays its players minimum wage and makes them travel on buses and sleep in Marriott hotels. McDonalds workers get paid more with better benefits. Carry on…
1.4961E+18,"@ussoccer @USWNT MUST NOT let the former US Soccer President anywhere near the office or organization again, ever"
1.4961E+18,@ussoccer @USWNT @RenzettiBruno
1.4961E+18,@ussoccer @USWNT Just a question. Where does all the money come from? if the womens game generates a lot of money and they have not been paid it well done. But in a commercial world then surely only monies earned can be distributed accordingly. Not attacking the decision just asking a question
1.4961E+18,@ussoccer @USWNT This money doesn’t even exist in women’s football
1.4961E+18,@ussoccer @USWNT The women’s team is the only team Americans pay attention to. They shouldn’t have to sue to receive equal pay to the team no one watches. SMH
1.4961E+18,"@ussoccer @USWNT This makes me really happy.  Congrats, @USWNT."
1.4961E+18,"@ussoccer @USWNT Brace yourselves, women will be cheering that equlibrium has been achieved, when the truth is WNT gets paid more then the men with health benefits. Let's see if they will cry for mens equal pay in the future"
1.4961E+18,"@ussoccer @USWNT Just hearing about the Women's US Soccer Team has finally reached an agreement with a legal battle in equal pay. I mean, Come on, it's 2022. Did they not learn anything when they feasted the NBA men and gave the NBA women scraps? Congrats #USWNT on your victory. Keep fighting."

1.4961E+18,@ussoccer @USWNT Does womens football generate the same interest publicly and commercially as mens? I somehow doubt it. The real battle would be convincing your fellow women to come and watch you - then the pay would have to be equal. Men get paid more as its mostly men who go to the games.
1.4961E+18,"@ussoccer @USWNT Are the Dallas Under-16s Boys team that were thrashing the US female international team 5-1 by half time, when the match got stopped, as it was toooooo embarrassing, going to be offered equal pay as well?"
1.4961E+18,@ussoccer @USWNT Can we advance equality in the level of head coaching mainly replacing the nepotist GGG with anyone else?

1.4961E+18,@ussoccer @USWNT Well done. Thank you. Proud of you especially knowing many of you will not see the increase in pay. The future thanks you.
1.4961E+18,@ussoccer @nwsl_players @USWNT took you long enough
1.4961E+18,"@ussoccer @USWNT Definitely deserving!  Women in sports are competitive as much as the men. But when I see the US women soccer team and it's make up, it doesn't representative  what America should be.  Fight for that!!!"

1.4961E+18,@ussoccer @USWNT So the contract they agreed to finally ended and they were able to professionally agree to a different deal? Huh. Imagine that.
1.4961E+18,"@ussoccer @USWNT I’m for equal pay. This could potentially open the door for the men to claim discrimination. Men don’t get paid if they don’t play, women do. The women previously declined the exact same contract as men so I’ll be interested to know the details of the new agreement."
1.4961E+18,"@ussoccer @USWNT AFT, standing together by necessity to avoid losing a lawsuit!  How about retro equal pay to the many women who have made Women’s National Soccer what it is?  When this happens then you can take credit"

1.4961E+18,"@ussoccer @USWNT Cool. Ask yourself this: are you on the same level as men's football or am I or others who think you're not are just sexists? Or, if you were to play the men's team, what would happen?"
1.4961E+18,"@ussoccer @USWNT Looooong overdue, but grateful it’s here now. Glad to see the respect given to those who have been fighting for this league and appropriate pay for a very long time. Well done ladies. Congratulations!"
1.4961E+18,@ussoccer @USWNT Lol WNT gunna be broke in a year. Where is the money gunna come from?
1.4961E+18,"@ussoccer @USWNT This is great, the USWNT have won lots of trophies and deserved equal pay. Congratulation."
1.4961E+18,"@ussoccer @USWNT By this rule of thinking, pay under 16 players the same, they deserve equality too,as they play also 90 minute games. And now that we are on it, pay a theater actor the same that a Hollywood star: same work, no?"
1.4961E+18,@ussoccer @USWNT Congratulations! This is wonderful news for #equalpay visibility!
1.4961E+18,@ussoccer @USWNT Congratulations and so much gratitude to the women of @USWNT for their persistence and their sacrifices to ensure equity in the workplace for women in soccer.
1.4961E+18,@ussoccer @USWNT I hope this is the beginning of the end of women’s soccer. Fans don’t show up. Nobody buying the Merch. How can you have all the benefits from the women’s cba and the men’s woth none of the risk. That’s it I’m done watching us soccer.
1.4961E+18,@ussoccer @USWNT I'll say it again. The USWNT deserves MORE pay than the men's team. The USWNT brings in much more money to the program and has won multiple World Cups and Olympic Gold medals. The men have won nothing and are on the verge of missing ANOTHER World Cup.
1.4961E+18,"@ussoccer @USWNT Equal pay? What? 

Women's team earned more than the men. 

They rejected an equal deal to the men. 

Now the women's team have 'settled' for a further $24m dollars. 

This is not about equality.

If it was, more than half of the $24m settlement should be going to the men"
1.4961E+18,@ussoccer @USWNT Wow absolutely amazing and embarrassing… like over here no one cares about woman’s football.  It’s not to deride it it’s just the truth. Woman’s football needs to grow naturally. All this trying to compare the men’s and woman’s team is embarrassing. Whether you like it or
1.4961E+18,"@ussoccer @USWNT Have no idea why this even had to go to court, seems rather obvious that the same job should pay the same.  I'm glad they fought for what was right. Pay them what they're worth! Great job changing the world ladies! #longoverdue #yetanothervictorybythesechampions"

1.52689E+18,"@ussoccer @USMNT @USWNT USAWNT definition of equality is stealing $ from the USAMNT since they bring in more money during the World Cup due to  various reasons such as they bring in more interest, viewership, and namely $$$.  Smells like socialism"
1.52689E+18,"@ussoccer @USMNT @USWNT Not really equal when if favours the women more. The men's World Cup generates more money through tv deals, sponsorship, tickets (they sell more and as hugely more expensive rates).

1.52689E+18,@ussoccer @USMNT @USWNT @CanadaSoccerEN this deal you’re currently putting together for the @CANWNT better equally compensate the women for all the work they’ve completed to pay the men for years! It’s time women were paid equally. Time for change!

1.52689E+18,"@ussoccer @USMNT @USWNT US Soccer should themselves as a federation be the ones compensating the gap for the woman’s team. Not allocating the money the Mens team make. For equal pay now this can work, but long term the Federation themselves Should allocate that money post 2028"
1.52689E+18,"@ussoccer @USMNT @USWNT The pay shouldn’t be equal, the percentage of pay from the total revenue is what should be equal. Whoever brings in more money, gets more money, sex doesn’t matter, simple."

1.52689E+18,@ussoccer @USMNT @USWNT The women have been bitching because they realised if they were on the Men's pay deal (which they rejected for a guaranteed level of pay) they would've gotten more money. Mind you the men would've gotten more if they were on women's pay deal.
1.52689E+18,@ussoccer @USMNT @USWNT Are you playing in Qatar?
1.52689E+18,@ussoccer @JERICHO @USMNT @USWNT I assume the women forfeited their entire former CBA that made them more money than the men to make this happen? Or are they making what they made before plus the tiny bit the men make?

1.52689E+18,@ussoccer @USMNT @USWNT So let me get this straight. Women's world cup soccer splits 30 million dollars between 30 teams. On the mens side 32 teams will split 400 million dollars. So the US men's team have to give 6.5 million dollars to the women team how is that even close to equal
